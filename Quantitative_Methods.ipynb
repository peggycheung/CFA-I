    "However, one shortcoming of using standard deviation is: a measure of risk is that both the positive deviation and negative deviation are considered. And if you are an investor, you probably would not consider the positive deviation as risk since you will be happy that the fund performs better. You'd only be concerned about the downside risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Downside Deviation\n",

    "\n",
    "Calculating downside deviation is similar to calculate standard deviation.\n",

    "e.g. If a fund manager claims that the fund has an expected return of 5%, we can set this as the target $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  The other important difference is that we only include negative deviations from the target in calculation, and that is when $X_{i}-B < 0$\n",
    "* Also note that the denominator remains the sample size $n$ minus 1, and that is $(n-1)$, even though we are not using all the observations in the numerator.\n",

    "### 4. Coefficient of Variation & Sharpe Ratio\n",

    "#### Calculate CV\n",
    "\n",
    "One application of standard deviation is to calculate the **coefficient of variation (CV)**. This is to address the issue of relative degree of variability of different data sets -- A direct comparison between the dispersion of two distributions is not meaningful because of the relatively large difference in their means.\n",

    "\n",
